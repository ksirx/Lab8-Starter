How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degredation and server workers are related in that they both tie into having the functionality of the website continue, even after the connection is gone. Graceful degradation deals with ensuring that even with muktiple things failing, the website is still functional. The service workers are what actually carry this out as it allows for functionality when offline. This means that both are tightly related in what they carry out and their purpose.
